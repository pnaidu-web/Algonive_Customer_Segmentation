##  Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Total_Amount  
- Quantity  
- Session_Duration_Minutes  
- Pages_Viewed  
- Customer_Rating  
- Is_Returning_Customer  

Total Records: 5000

##  Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Handling Missing Values  
3. Converting Categorical Data to Numeric  
4. Feature Selection  
5. Feature Scaling using StandardScaler  
6. Determining optimal clusters using Elbow Method  
7. Applying K-Means Clustering  
8. Visualization of customer segments

## Clustering Results

Customers were segmented into 4 clusters:

-  Cluster 0 – Premium High-Spending Customers  
-  Cluster 1 – Loyal Returning Customers  
-  Cluster 2 – Regular Customers  
-  Cluster 3 – Low-Engagement Customers

##  Business Insights

- High-spending customers should receive exclusive offers.
- Loyal customers can be targeted with reward programs.
- Low-engagement customers need reactivation marketing strategies.
- Data-driven segmentation helps businesses improve customer retention.
